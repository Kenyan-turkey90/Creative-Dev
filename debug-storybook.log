[11:47:32.507] [ERROR] Unable to initialize Storybook in this directory.

Storybook couldn't detect a supported framework or configuration for your project. Make sure you're inside a framework project (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js) and that its dependencies are installed.

Tips:
- Run init in an empty directory or create a new framework app first.
- If this directory contains unrelated files, try a new directory for Storybook.
